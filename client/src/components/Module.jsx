<h2> Tour of the Cell</h2>
Prokaryotic cells are early cells that do not have a nucleus, which means that the DNA is not enclosed in a membrane. The smallest known prokaryotic cells are bacteria called mycoplasmas (0.1 and 1.0 µm in diameter). Typical bacteria are 1–5 µm in diameter. Prokaryotic cells use long “tails” to propel their movement, called flagella, which run in a rotary movement, like whips, using a rotary motor system.
<p> </p>
The interior of pro and eukaryotes is the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic cell has several types of membrane-bounded organelles suspended in the cytosol, which are absent in prokaryotic cells.
Some prokaryotic cells may include regions bounded by proteins (not real membranes). These “compartments” are where specific reactions take place.
<p> </p>
Plasma membrane is a selective barrier (system of gates) that allows passage of molecules, such as oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to and from the entire cell. Naturally, only a limited amount of traffic can cross per second per square micron of the available surface. Therefore, if the cell gets too big, it won’t have enough membrane surface to satisfy its traffic needs.
<p> </p>
Remember that as the diameter of the cell increases, its size increases a lot more than its surface area (size is cubed but surface area is squared), so the ratio of surface area to volume actually gets smaller with increasing diameter. This is why the cell size has a limit beyond which the cell cannot maintain its vital functions. To overcome this limitation, larger organisms needed to have more cells, not larger cells (became multi-cellular). In other words, larger organisms do not generally have larger cells than smaller organisms—they simply have more cells.
<p> </p>
Surface area of each cell is calculated as: A=4πr2A=4πr2.
